# DoodleClassifier
## This is my simple version of the doodle classifier using Google's Quick,Draw! dataset.

This is a basic neural network implimented using Tensorflow/Keras in python and then transfered over to Javascript where I used Tensorflow.js and P5 library to make the model more usable, easier to access, try out and test.

</br>Feel free to try out [the model](https://srikar-ayyala.github.io/doodleClassifier/) for yourself!

</br>Dataset: [The Quick, Draw! Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) ( with randomization and image processing for better performance )
</br>doodle categories: cat, helicopter, octopus, popsicle, tractor
</br>testing accuracy: 88%

</br>This is where I plan to leave this project here for now and learn some other more complex concepts in machine learning and make more projects. Maybe some day i'll come back to this with more knowledge and try to improve on this and make it better.
