# DoodleClassifier
## This is my simple version of the doodle classifier using Google's Quick,Draw! dataset.

This is a basic neural network implimented using Tensorflow/Keras in python
And then transfered over to Javascript where I used Tensorflow.js and P5 library to make the model more usable, easier to access, try out and test.

Feel free to try out the model for yourself!
